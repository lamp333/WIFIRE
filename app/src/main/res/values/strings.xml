    <string name="about_content">WIFIRE is a wildfire analysis system that uses satellite and sensor data to
        monitor weather patterns, which can be used to predict the spread of wildfires.

        \n\nThe purpose of this app is to allow users near wildfire sites to take pictures of the fires and send
        these pictures to our servers.  These pictures can give us more useful data about fires beyond what the
        satellites can capture, which will be very helpful in future fire predictions.

        \n\nFor more information about WIFIRE, visit wifire.ucsd.edu

        \n\nProgrammers: Adam Liu, Christopher Ozawa, Jamie Zhang

        \n\nInspiration: Jurgen Schulze, John Graham
